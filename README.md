# CyrTec services — How can I help?

## At CyrTec, I do two things.

### Organize and instruct Lego Robotics programs in the region.
I mentor kids 7 - 10 years old in an early experience with Lego robots.  At this level the goal is to provide a positive and supportive environment for kids with early interest in robotics.  The course begins with some simple and whimsical robots -- claws and rovers are always a hit!  The instruction is kept light and simple and each child is encouraged to make changes to the robots as they see fit.  Currently this program is running at the Old Town, Maine parks and Recreation department.

I teach kids 9 - 14 years old how to build Lego robots, program them, and solve the engineering problems associated with getting everything to work.  I'm a strong believer that every kid can both build and program robots.  At the level kids learn to use most sensors, detect obstacles, follow a line, and more.

### Programming and Network Engineering for organizations and businesses.
If it runs software or is connected to a network or the web, I’m here to help.  I have more than 20 years of experience in the IT industry — computer networks, security, programming, management, and the web.  I know that simple is better and I’m brand agnostic.  I am comfortable making specific recommendations and assisting with purchasing.
